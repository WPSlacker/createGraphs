====================

Deliverables:
1) survBankrupt_v2.3
This contains the D3js for the survival analysis of business bankruptcies (or turn-over) for a particular area.  This will evolve as data (D&B) is made available.
ToDo: Discuss data flow / architecture with Kathy.  Discuss Use Cases with real estate people.

2) gmpExamp
This contains a d3/dc dashboard showing basic information for a metropolitan area, and tracts within it.
ToDo: Add tract data as it becomes available for every city.

3) slider
This contains the gmpExamp graphs, but provides for a tool (3 different types) to combine many graphs into a small window (ie carousel type effects).
ToDo: Display different tools to people (Boris/Stefan) for what they want implemented.
